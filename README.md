# QIt
Query It - takes a list of hashes or searches for urlquery, runs the search and tells you which ones you already new about (diff between previous time you ran the searches). It just stores the domain/url/time found in urlquery, saves that data in a json file, and the next time it is run will not print out the info for those domains again.

I intend to eventually add support to create ACE alerts for each new domain found. (ace-ecosystem integration)
